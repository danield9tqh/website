description: RPC Chain | Iron Fish Documentation
---

Estimates the fee rate given an optional priority. If no fee rate is provided, the `average` priority will be used.

Fee rates are estimated from the distribution of transaction fees over the last 10 blocks. The fee rate for each transaction is computed by dividing the transaction fee in $ORE by the size of the transaction in kB.

The slow, average, and fast rates each come from a percentile in the distribution:

- slow: 10th
- average: 20th
- fast: 30th

#### Request

```ts
{
  priority: 'slow' | 'average' | 'fast'
} | undefined
```

#### Response

```ts
{
  rate: string;
}
```
